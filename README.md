## Refined

Set of predicates and ready-to-go schemas to make you data definitions as precise
as possible while maintaining extendiblity and readability of your code.

Sounds sophisticated? Well... The idea is to keep you away from errors & bugs,
to learn more - check out examples :) 

```clojure
[com.attendify/schema-refined "0.3.0"]
```

## Our Goals

* **Readability** and **Soundness**

* Being **as precise as we can**

* Avoid **as many bugs** as possible

## Talks and Tutorials

* [Keep Your Data Safe with Refinement Types](TBD)

## Usage 

TBD

## Inspired By

* [Refined in Haskell](https://github.com/nikita-volkov/refined)
* [Refined in Scala](https://github.com/fthomas/refined)
